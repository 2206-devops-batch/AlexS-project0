# AlexS Project 0 - Python Application

## Description
It is a retail store where users can order items. 

## Why use python?
This project was made easier in Python because it is a high level programming langauge with garbage collecting, dynamically-typing and object oriented features. Most importantly, python emphasize on code readability which also made it easier to learn. 

## Challenges I Face:
- Finding out one line of code can easily do the same thing as my 10 lines of code

## Future Features:
- Seller Membership: A user can sell items and put any price on it.

- Better Menu: A menu made of pages where each page would only include at most 10 items. This way it would be easier to look for item.

- Search Bar: If the item database becomes too much, a search bar is needed.
